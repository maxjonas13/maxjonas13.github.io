Text: 

This is it, This is the day the world stood still.
My mother gave me the gift of life. Although I didn't breath much in the beginning, I managed to survive the most important moment of my Live

All mother but mine cried, because their child wasn't me. 
Because, I'm awesome.

But enough said, This was my start.
The start of my Story.
